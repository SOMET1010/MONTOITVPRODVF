  "title": "Mon Toit - Plateforme de Location Immobilière en Côte d'Ivoire",
  "url": "https://somet1010-montoit-st-jcvj.bolt.host/recherche",
  "summary": "The page is a search interface for a real estate rental platform named 'Mon Toit' in Côte d'Ivoire. It allows users to filter properties by city and type, displays a list of 31 properties with key details (price, type, location, rooms, area), and provides navigation to other parts of the site as well as footer information.",
  "key_points": [
    {
      "section": "General Page Structure",
      "details": "The page includes a header with navigation (Accueil, Rechercher, Connexion, Inscription), a main content area for search filters and results, and a comprehensive footer with quick links, legal information, a newsletter signup, and contact details."
    },
    {
      "section": "Search and Filtering",
      "details": "Users can search for properties using two main filters: 'Toutes les villes' (listing 15 cities including Abidjan, Yamoussoukro, Bouaké, etc.) and 'Tous les types' (listing property types like Appartement, Maison, Villa, Studio, Duplex, Local Commercial, Bureau). A 'Rechercher' button applies the filters."
    },
    {
      "section": "Property Listings",
      "details": "The page displays '31 propriétés trouvées'. Each property card presents: a 'NOUVEAU' tag, monthly rental price (e.g., 200,000 FCFA/mois), property title/type, location (city and district), number of bedrooms (ch), number of bathrooms (sdb), and area (m²). Each card is a clickable link to a detailed property page (e.g., /proprietes/{uuid})."
    },
    {
      "section": "Inferred Real-time Functionalities",
      "details": "Based on the static content, no direct real-time filtering (e.g., results updating instantly as filters are changed without a button click) is observable. The presence of a 'Rechercher' button suggests an explicit action to apply filters, which might trigger a server-side query or API call rather than continuous real-time updates. However, modern web applications often implement dynamic updates on search pages, so this could be an area for future implementation or relies on client-side JavaScript not visible in the static content."
    },
    {
      "section": "Inferred Supabase API Calls",
      "details": "Given the goal's mention of Supabase, it's highly probable that API calls to a Supabase backend are used for: 1. Fetching property listings based on search criteria (cities, types). 2. Loading the dynamic options for the city and type filters. 3. Handling user authentication (Connexion, Inscription) for registered users. 4. Potentially storing and retrieving detailed property information and images. Supabase's PostgREST APIs would be suitable for these data operations."
    },
    {
      "section": "Inferred WebSocket Connections",
      "details": "No direct evidence of WebSocket connections is apparent on this static search results page. While Supabase offers real-time capabilities via WebSockets for database changes, a typical property search page doesn't inherently require continuous real-time updates for its primary function of displaying static search results. They *could* be used for features like live notifications for new listings or real-time chat, but not for the current display."
    },
    {
      "section": "Potential Edge Functions",
      "details": "Given the 'Bolt.host' URL, which often indicates a serverless or edge computing environment, Edge Functions are likely employed for: 1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG) of the initial page content for performance and SEO. 2. Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) logic, acting as an intermediary for Supabase API calls to handle authentication, data transformation, or specific business logic at the edge. 3. Image optimization and serving property images efficiently. 4. Request routing and caching for improved latency."
    },
